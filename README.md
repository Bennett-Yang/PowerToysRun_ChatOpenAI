## Features
For the scenarios of PowerToys Run, you may want an answer as concise as possible. If you agree to it, ChatOpenAI is the plugin you need!

You can:
- Use your own OpenAI API or OpenAI compatible API.
- Specify the model you want.
- Get your answer after you type an ending character to save a few tokens for you (you can disable it if you do not like it).
- Click to copy the answer.
